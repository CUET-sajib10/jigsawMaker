it is a sample that makes several pictures together to create a new picture.
Every picture has it's own region as a frame ,we can drag one border and it will effect other relevant frame  as below:

  you can drag picture to where is out of the region frame and it will go back to the frame through a animation 
  or you also can exchange picture by a long press on one picture and drag to another picture's region frame as below::

  ofcourse,rotate your picture and change the dimension of the frame of picture is basic:

  add some effect as filter to picture is better:
